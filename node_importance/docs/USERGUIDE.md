- weight (Optional. Default is False): If True, then the weights in the given graph are used. If no weights are given, all edge weights are considered equal.
- directed (Optional. Default is False). If True the graph is treated as a directed graph where the first specified node in an edge is the source node.
- in_out (Optinal. String value. Default is the empty string '' or the string 'in'). This is used when the graph is a directed graph. Supply the string 'in' or leave setting the parameter (that is it will have value of the null string '') if you want to calculate 'left' eigenvector centrality which corresponds to the in-edges in the graph. Use the string 'out' or anyother string to calculate the out-edges eigenvector centrality.

## PageRank

Find the PageRank of nodes.

A dictionary with a key for some subset of graph nodes and personalization value each of those. At least one personalization value must be non-zero. If not specfiied, a nodes personalization value will be zero. By default, a uniform distribution is used.
- max_iter (Optional. Integer. Default is 100): Maximum number of iterations in power method eigenvalue solver.
- tol (Optional. Float. Default is 1e-06): Maximum number of iterations in power method eigenvalue solver.
- nstart (Optional. Dictionary. If you skip setting this field, you will get the default behavior): It is a dictionary of starting values of eigenvector iteration for each node. I.e., each node would have a corresponding value.
- weight (Optional. Default is False): If True, then the weights in the given graph are used. If no weights are given, all edge weights are set to one.
- dangling (Optional. Dictionary. If you skip setting this field, you will get the default behavior): The outedges to be assigned to nodes without any outedges. The dict key is the node the outedge points to and the dict value is the weight of that outedge. By default, dangling nodes are given outedges according to the personalization vector (uniform if not specified). This must be selected to result in an irreducible transition matrix. It may be common to have the dangling dict to be the same as the personalization dict.
- directed (Optional. Default is False). If True the graph is treated as a directed graph where the first specified node in an edge is the source node.
